## particloud55

[Web Three.js demo](http://strainer.github.io/particloud55/)

A quick threejs particle cloud excercise.
* View of cloud automatically spins and zooms.
* Cloud also expands, contracts, inverts.
* Particles are very slowly drawn to each other -squeezed by a randomly offest grid generated each frame.

Eventually the particle clouds become distorted into sheets and strings. 

### Primitive flying controls: 
* cursor keys spin, 
* a-z zooms in out.
